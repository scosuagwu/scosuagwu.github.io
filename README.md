# About Me

## My Interest
I like to play sports, video games, watch shows, and listen to music one thing that I take pride in is that when it comes to all of those different hobbies I do things that most may not expect. for example I play basketball, and football,  but I also enjoy playing tennis. academically I want to have a career in cybersecurity but also round out my knowledge by getting some certifications in other fields within IT like the _CompTIA A+_ as well as the _CCNA_. one thing most don't know about me is that I'm working on a comic hopefully that pops off one day (**if your an artist hit my line**).

## Websites I Recommend

* [Youtube](www.youtube.com)- I enjoy learning new things as well being entertained by creators on youtube.
* [Google Docs](workspace.google.com/products/docs/)- I use google docs to note take as well as write down any ideas I have for my comic.
